        <li><strong>Domain and Hosting:</strong> Register a domain name that reflects your niche and purchase web hosting from a reliable provider. Choose a hosting plan that meets your website's requirements for performance, scalability, and security.</li>
        <li><strong>Design and Development:</strong> Design a user-friendly website with a clean layout, intuitive navigation, and responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices and screen sizes.

        <li><strong>Create Quality Content:</strong> Develop high-quality, relevant content that provides value to your target audience and addresses their needs, questions, and interests. Publish blog posts, articles, guides, tutorials, and other types of content that showcase your expertise and establish your authority in the niche.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimize for Search Engines:</strong> Implement search engine optimization (SEO) strategies to improve your website's visibility and rankings in search engine results pages (SERPs). Optimize your content, meta tags, headings, images, and internal links for relevant keywords and phrases to attract organic traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>Monetize with Ads:</strong> Sign up for ad networks such as Google AdSense, Media.net, or AdThrive and place ad units strategically throughout your website to maximize visibility and clicks.

        <li><strong>Drive Traffic:</strong> Promote your website through various online and offline channels to attract targeted traffic from sources such as search engines, social media, email marketing, content marketing, influencer partnerships, and online communities. Engage with your audience, participate in relevant discussions, and encourage sharing and referrals to increase traffic and engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Analyze and Iterate:</strong> Monitor your website's performance using web analytics tools such as Google Analytics or Matomo.
