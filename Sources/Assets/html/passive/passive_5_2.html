    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>CPA Marketing, or Cost Per Action Marketing, is a type of affiliate marketing where an advertiser pays a commission to the affiliate for a specific action completed by a user. This action can be anything from filling out a form, signing up for a newsletter, making a purchase, or downloading an app.</p>

    <h2>How CPA Marketing Works</h2>
    <p>In CPA Marketing, affiliates promote offers provided by advertisers. When users perform the desired action (e.g., submit an email, complete a survey, etc.), the affiliate earns a commission. This model ensures that advertisers only pay for actual conversions.</p>
