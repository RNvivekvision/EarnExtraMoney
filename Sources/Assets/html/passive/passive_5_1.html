    <h1>Affiliate Marketing</h1>
    <p>Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing where a business rewards one or more affiliates for each visitor or customer brought by the affiliate's own marketing efforts. It is a popular way for individuals and businesses to earn money online by promoting products and services offered by other companies.</p>
    
    <h2>How Affiliate Marketing Works</h2>
    <p>Affiliate marketing involves three primary parties: the advertiser, the publisher (affiliate), and the consumer.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertiser:</strong> This is the company that creates and owns the product or service. They offer an affiliate program that allows affiliates to promote their offerings in exchange for a commission.</li>
        <li><strong>Publisher (Affiliate):</strong> This is the individual or company that promotes the advertiser's product or service. Affiliates use various marketing strategies to drive traffic to the advertiser's website and earn commissions on resulting sales or leads.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer:</strong> This is the end-user who interacts with the affiliate's marketing content and ultimately makes a purchase or completes a desired action on the advertiser's website.</li>
    </ul>
