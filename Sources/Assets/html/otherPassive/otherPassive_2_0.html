    <h1>Licensing Photography or Art</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Licensing photography or art involves granting permission for the use of images or artwork in various ways, typically in exchange for a fee or under specific terms and conditions. It's a crucial aspect of protecting intellectual property rights while allowing others to utilize creative works.</p>

    <p>There are several types of licenses commonly used in photography and art:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rights Managed (RM):</strong> This type of license grants specific rights to the licensee for a defined purpose, duration, and geographic region. It often involves negotiation for each use.</li>
        <li><strong>Royalty-Free (RF):</strong> RF licenses allow for broad usage of an image or artwork for a one-time fee. The licensee can use the content multiple times without additional payments, within the terms of the license.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Domain:</strong> Works in the public domain are not protected by copyright and can be used freely by anyone for any purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Creative Commons:</strong> Creative Commons licenses provide a flexible range of protections and freedoms for authors, artists, and educators.</li>
