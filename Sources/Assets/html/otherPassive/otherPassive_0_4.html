        <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Understand zoning regulations, building codes, parking permits, ADA requirements, and other legal requirements governing parking facilities and operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Analysis:</strong> Conduct market research on parking demand, competition, pricing, occupancy rates, and trends in the local parking market to set competitive lease rates and maximize revenue.</li>
        <li><strong>Lease Agreements:</strong> Draft clear and comprehensive lease agreements outlining terms and conditions, lease duration, rental rates, payment terms, responsibilities, and rights of both parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> Implement security measures such as surveillance cameras, access control systems, lighting, and patrols to ensure the safety and security of parked vehicles and customers.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Service:</strong> Provide excellent customer service, convenient payment options, user-friendly parking facilities, and responsive support to attract and retain tenants and parkers.</li>

        <li><strong>Operational Costs:</strong> Incur operational costs for maintenance, repairs, security, insurance, utilities, marketing, and administrative expenses, which can affect profitability and investment returns.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Concerns:</strong> Address security concerns such as theft, vandalism, accidents, liability claims, and personal safety issues, implementing measures to mitigate risks and ensure a safe parking environment.</li>
