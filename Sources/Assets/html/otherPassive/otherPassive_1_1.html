    <h1>Automated Dropshipping Store</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>An automated dropshipping store is an e-commerce business model where the retailer does not keep goods in stock. Instead, when a product is sold, the item is purchased from a third party (usually a wholesaler or manufacturer) and shipped directly to the customer. Automation tools and software streamline this process, making it easier to manage.</p>
