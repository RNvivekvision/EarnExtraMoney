        <li>Front-End Development: Involves writing code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to implement the design and make the website interactive and responsive across different devices and screen sizes.</li>
        <li>Back-End Development: Handles server-side programming and database management to support the functionality of the website, such as user authentication, data processing, and content management.</li>
        <li>Content Management: Involves creating, editing, and managing the content of the website, including text, images, videos, and other multimedia elements, using content management systems (CMS) or custom solutions.</li>
        <li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Optimizes the website's structure, content, and performance to improve its visibility and ranking in search engine results, driving organic traffic and engagement.</li>
        <li>Security: Implements security measures and best practices to protect the website from cyber threats, data breaches, and malicious attacks, ensuring the safety and privacy of users and data.</li>

    <h2>Website Development Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Planning: Define the goals, objectives, and target audience of the website, and create a project plan outlining the scope, timeline, and resources required for development.</li>
        <li>Design: Create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to visualize the layout, structure, and user interface of the website, and finalize the design based on feedback and iteration.</li>
        <li>Development: Write front-end and back-end code to implement the design, build functionality, and integrate with databases, APIs, and third-party services as needed.</li>
        <li>Testing: Conduct thorough testing and quality assurance to identify and fix any bugs, errors, or usability issues, ensuring that the website functions correctly and performs well across different devices and browsers.</li>
        <li>Deployment: Launch the website on a web server or hosting platform, configure domain settings, and perform final checks to ensure that the website is live and accessible to users.</li>
        <li>Maintenance: Monitor the website's performance, security, and functionality on an ongoing basis, and perform regular updates, backups, and maintenance tasks to keep the website running smoothly and securely.</li>
