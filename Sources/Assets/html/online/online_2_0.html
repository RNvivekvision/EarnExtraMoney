    <h1>Print on Demand (POD)</h1>
    
    <h2>What is Print on Demand?</h2>
    <p>Print on Demand (POD) is a business model where products are printed only when an order is placed, eliminating the need for inventory. This model is commonly used for printing custom designs on items such as t-shirts, hoodies, mugs, phone cases, and other merchandise. POD services handle the printing, packing, and shipping directly to the customer.</p>
