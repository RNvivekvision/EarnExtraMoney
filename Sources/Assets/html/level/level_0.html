    <h1>Vision</h1>
    <p>When it comes to survival, we are visual animals. As a species, our eyesight is our most developed sense. We have stereoscopic sight that can detect a wide variety of colours and shading. This, in turn, lets us easily see patterns and movement. These combined abilities allowed us to avoid becoming dinner while trying to get dinner for ourselves. Our vision helped us to physically succeed, and it still does today.</p>

    <h2>Vision in Business</h2>
    <p>When it comes to business success, vision is no less important to survival. However, instead of our sense of sight, this vision involves our sense of imagination and possibility. Vision, in the business sense, is really the ability to visualize successful outcomes. It is the ability to imagine positive results. It is, at its heart, the ability to lucidly dream of where you want to go with your business.</p>

    <h2>The Power of Visualization</h2>
    <p>Don’t be afraid to dream. As Henry Ford once said, "If you think you can do something or if you think you can’t do something, you’re right." So, spend a few minutes each day visualizing where exactly you plan on going and how you plan on getting there. This is not daydreaming, far from it. This is focused development, scheduling, and organization. Plan your day by seeing the optimum outcomes. This is the same process that athletes use to hone their performance. When you imagine yourself succeeding, you are more likely to actually succeed. Remember, if you don’t take the time to build your own dreams, someone will hire you to take the time to build theirs.</p>

    <h2>Steps to Develop a Vision</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Identify Your Goals:</strong> Clearly define what you want to achieve in the short and long term.</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Common Obstacles to Maintaining Vision</h2>

        <li><strong>Procrastination:</strong> Delaying action can hinder progress. Break your goals into smaller tasks to make them more manageable.</li>
    </ul>
